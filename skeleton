compiled using gcc
show coverage using gcov
gdb working diff in 3 procs:
>signal handling using gdb
>code injection while run, printing values
>tracing and breaking(refer to heisenberg debugging)
>info registers

gcc discussing flags required for each examinition
Call them 2 process and a mini OS(subystem)
analysis using 3G rulers of C

proc1 waits for signal from proc2...if it doesn't get one , sends itself. Flush.gcov in this prog
proc2 waits for the user to input data, searches it..sends different signals for yes and no
apply tracing here.
